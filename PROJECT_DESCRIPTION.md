App specification:

App name: TrustLimit

App description:
Smart Transaction Throttling for Fintech companies (aka FinTechs).

TrustLimit is a real-time API + admin dashboard that helps fintechs enforce programmable transaction controls to prevent internal fraud, misuse, and compliance violations.

Think: "feature flags for money."
You wrap your transactions in trustLimit.check() to instantly allow/deny/alert based on role, time, risk profile, and transaction context.
What Problem Are We Solving?
Fintechs, neobanks, and finance platforms face critical challenges when it comes to enforcing internal financial controls. These challenges often result in fraud, operational risk, regulatory exposure, and financial loss. The current solutions (manual workflows, spreadsheets, hardcoded business logic) are brittle, unscalable, and error-prone.

Here’s a comprehensive list of real-world use cases and problems TrustLimit addresses:


Time-Based Risk Controls
Blocking high-value transactions submitted outside business hours (e.g. transfers after 8PM)
Preventing activity on weekends/public holidays for non-executive roles
Delaying approvals or enforcing cooling-off periods at night
Flagging transactions during "risk windows" (e.g. Friday night cash-outs)


Role-Based Spending Policies
Setting stricter limits for interns, juniors, or contractors
Requiring multi-level approval for managers and above
Restricting finance team access during audits
Blocking support agents from issuing excessive refunds
In many fintech platforms or marketplaces, support agents are given the ability to issue refunds or credits to users (e.g., resolving complaints). Without proper controls, agents can:
Issue too many refunds in a short period (e.g., 10+ per hour)
Refund large amounts without managerial oversight
Issue refunds outside of normal working hours (e.g., 3AM)
Abuse access to refund themselves or accomplices


TrustLimit can enforce:


Max refund amount per transaction
Daily refund caps per support role
Approval thresholds (e.g., >€100 needs manager review)
Time-based limits (e.g., only allow refunds between 08:00–20:00)


Geo-Contextual Enforcement
Blocking transactions initiated from non-whitelisted regions
Detecting geo mismatch (e.g. user IP in Ukraine, card issued in Spain)
Limiting transaction types by region (e.g. no international wires from junior staff)
Preventing card usage outside designated countries


Velocity and Frequency Throttling
Blocking more than 3 transactions per minute per user
Enforcing daily or hourly caps on transaction volume or amount
Limiting transaction frequency for newly onboarded users
Blocking "burst" activity patterns indicating abuse or automation


Spending Pattern Anomaly Detection
Detecting sharp increases in daily/monthly spending
Flagging one-time large purchases significantly deviating from history
Identifying atypical merchant category codes (MCC) per user role
Detecting rapid accumulation of small transfers (“smurfing” behavior)


Approval and Escalation Flows
Auto-blocking transactions that require manager/CFO approval
Triggering policy exceptions for review (e.g. flight ticket at midnight)
Generating justification logs for high-risk spend
Enforcing dual-approval for payments above €10K


Company-Level Spend Enforcement
Blocking new spend if company-level monthly budget exceeded
Alerting when department-level budget thresholds are crossed
Applying limits dynamically based on real-time budget utilization
Detecting policy-violating department behavior (e.g. Marketing >2× baseline)


Fraud & Internal Abuse Prevention
Detecting ghost users or dormant accounts suddenly sending money
Blocking suspicious wallet or account pairings (e.g. duplicate IBANs)
Identifying insiders attempting to move funds to personal accounts
Flagging privilege escalation abuse (e.g. role changed before transfer)


Compliance and Audit Use Cases
Creating immutable logs of every allowed/blocked transaction
Generating automated summaries of spend anomalies for compliance teams
Tracking rule version history and enforcement actions
Proving adherence to SOX / PCI-DSS / ISO / AMLD / MiCA policies


AI-Driven Policy Creation and Monitoring
Generating recommended rules based on past transactions
Detecting unusual behavior without predefined thresholds
Explaining rejected transactions in plain language (“This exceeds the user’s daily norm by 5× and occurred outside allowed hours.”)
Suggesting rule optimizations based on risk trends


Summary
These problems occur daily in fast-moving fintech environments and become exponentially harder to manage at scale. TrustLimit replaces messy internal code, brittle spreadsheets, and human error with a developer-friendly, AI-powered API that enforces trust, governance, and safety by design.

MVP Scope Prioritization for TrustLimit
Below is a breakdown of the most valuable and feasible features to include in the MVP during the hackathon — selected for high impact, demo readiness, and real business value. This should guide the agent to focus development on the most essential and showcase-worthy components.


Core MVP Features to Keep in Scope
1. Time-Based Risk Controls
   Blocking high-value transactions outside business hours
   Simple to implement via timestamp checks
   Highly demoable ("Try sending €10K at 3AM")
   Provides immediate value to fintechs seeking basic fraud and misuse controls
2. Role-Based Spending Policies ✅
   Setting stricter limits for interns, juniors, or contractors
   Rules can be role-scoped in config
   Useful and relatable to neobanks, expense tools, and finance platforms
   Enables custom policies per user type (interns, support agents, execs, etc.)
3. Velocity and Frequency Throttling
   Blocking more than X transactions per time window
   Can be built using Redis counters or in-memory cache
   Great demo appeal with burst simulation
   Prevents abuse, automation, or behavioral anomalies
4. Geo-Contextual Enforcement
   Blocking transactions from non-whitelisted regions
   Detecting geo mismatch (e.g. IP from Ukraine, account based in France)
   Adds a meaningful security layer
   Popular with compliance teams and regulators
   Can use simple mock IP-to-country mapping for demo purposes
5. Approval and Escalation Flows (Basic)
   Auto-blocking transactions above a threshold until approved
   Easy to simulate: “Manager must approve €10K+ transfers”
   Enables demos showing workflows and enforcement UX


Stretch or Out-of-Scope Features (Not for MVP)
AI-Driven Policy Creation and Monitoring
Requires integrating AI model (e.g. GPT) to suggest or auto-generate rule logic
High complexity, risky to scope for 36-hour hackathon
Recommend deferring to post-MVP if time allows
Company-Level Spend Enforcement
Needs aggregation of budgets across multiple users/departments
Complex data structures and real-time budget updates
Full Fraud & Internal Abuse Detection Engine
Requires behavioral profiling, history tracking, and alert logic
Better suited for V2 with access to real transaction flows
Full Compliance & Audit Suite
Logging, version control, and SOX/AML integration is backend-heavy
Important but not exciting for a live demo
Advanced Spending Pattern Anomaly Detection
Needs historical baselining and time-series outlier detection
Could use basic hardcoded thresholds instead for MVP


Hackathon MVP Stack
Core Feature Set to Build:

Role-based policy engine (configurable limits per user type)
Time-based rule enforcement (working hours, weekends)
Velocity limits (e.g. no >3 tx/minute)
Geo-based blocking and mismatch detection
Approval flow simulation (e.g. CFO approval for large transfers)

This stack ensures: Real-time rule enforcement
Strong security/compliance narrative
Clear UX and business use case
Powerful demo potential

Target Market
Primary Customers:

Fintech startups (neobanks, crypto wallets, expense platforms)
B2B financial SaaS (payroll, treasury, spend management tools)
Compliance-focused platforms (KYC/AML vendors, CFO tools)

End Users:

CFOs and finance controllers at startups
Fintech product & compliance teams
Developers building financial features (transfers, cards, payouts)
Employees that are actually spending money (they can see transaction logs, remaining budget, etc)


Why Will This Be a Successful Business?
1. The Pain Is Real and Growing
   1000s of new fintechs and B2B SaaS startups handle financial operations
   Every one of them needs internal spend guardrails but lacks time/people to build them
2. Monetization Path Is Clear
   SaaS API pricing per volume of checks (Stripe-like model)
   Premium tiers with webhook alerts, audit logs, analytics
   Security/compliance teams love “just works” tools
3. It’s a Must-Have, Not a Nice-to-Have
   Controls like this are required under SOX, ISO, PCI, and SOC 2
   Adds defensibility for fintech startups in front of investors, regulators, and enterprise customers
