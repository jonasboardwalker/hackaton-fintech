For a hackathon, we are creating a simplified app.

The app has an admin dashboard that our clients (fintech employees) will use. This app will show these screens:

1. Dashboard (summary, statistics)
2. Rules (allows CRUD on rules)
3. Alerts (list of unresolved and resolved alerts, allows resolving with a negative or positive result)
4. Transactions (history of all transactions)
